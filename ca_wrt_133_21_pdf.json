KARALLIYADDE, J.\nCounsel: Shantha Jayawardena with Ms. Hiranya Damunupola and Ms.\nAzra Basheer for the Petitioners.\nMs. Nayomi Kahawita S. C. for the Respondents.\nArgued on: 18.05.2023\nWritten Submissions on: 28.08.2023 (by the Petitioners)\nDecided on: 29.11.2023\nMOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.\nThe Petitioners in this Application are seeking Orders in the nature of Writs\nof Mandamus pursuing several directions for inter alia, increasing vacancies\nfor admission of students to government schools for Grade 6 for the year 2021,\ndetermination of cut-off marks of the 2020 Grade 5 scholarship examination\nfor admission to Grade 6 of government schools for 2021 based on calculation\nof vacancies, additional intakes for Grade 6 and also Orders seeking\npublication and adoption of certain criteria.\nPage 6 of 10", "7": "This Application concerns the admission of students including the Petitioners,\nto Grade 6 classes based on their performance at the Grade 5 scholarship\nexamination. It is submitted that the scholarship exam was introduced in\n1948 with the objectives of providing an equal opportunity for every child to\npursue their education and goals based on his or her performance and merit,\nand to admit talented students to better schools of higher grade with improved\nsystems and infrastructure and also to provide bursaries to bright, but\neconomically disadvantaged, students. The exam measures the ability and\nlearning potential across 14 specified areas, and tests knowledge on the first\nlanguage, mathematics, and environment. The exam is taken by students in\nall types of schools across different socioeconomic groups.\nIt is submitted by the Petitioners that in terms of Advanced Level subject\nstreams and grades, government schools are classified as 1AB Super (Schools\nwhich have all A/L streams including Technology), 1AB (Schools which have\nall A/L streams except Technology), 1C (Schools which have no\nScience/Maths Streams), Type 2 (Schools which have Grades 1 - 11 only) and\nType 3 (Schools which have Grades 1 - 5 only).\nThe 1st to 10th Petitioners were admitted to grade 1 in the year 2016 and sat\nfor the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination conducted by the Department of\nExaminations on 12.10.2020 with the intention of entering/being admitted to\nbetter schools, whereas 9 of them were already in Type 1AB schools and other\nwas in a Type 3 school. Based on their results (marked \u2018P1\u2019), they submitted\napplications to their preferred schools through the Ministry of Education\n(marked \u2018P2\u2019) and were selected to other schools (marked \u2018P2\u2019) despite their\nprimary/prime preferences due to higher cut-off marks for admission in those\nschools (marked \u2018P3\u2019).\nThe Petitioners submit that the determination of cut-off marks for a particular\nschool depends on the number of slots available at a particular school for\nadmission students to Grade 6 and overall performance of the students at the\nscholarship examination. The primary contention of the Petitioners is that\nPage 7 of 10", "8": "students have been admitted in excess of the permitted figures for each\ngrade/class and that has led to reducing the number of slots for admission\nfor Grade 6 which in turn reduces the number of students that are able to be\nadmitted in a particular school through the Grade 5 scholarship examination,\nleading to an increase in the cut-off marks.\nIt is submitted by the Respondents that scholarship holders are admitted at\nGrade 6 based on vacancies in classrooms and all students that have applied\nto a particular school and scored marks equal or higher than the cut-off mark\nwould be admitted to the school even if it exceeds the number of vacancies in\nspecific classrooms.\nThe Petitioners submit that on 14.10.2015 the Cabinet of Ministers decided\nthat from the year 2016 onwards, the number of students admitted to Grade\n1 should be reduced by 01 student per year, with the limit for the 2016\nadmissions being 40 students until the number reaches 35, by the year 2020.\nThe said cabinet decision was incorporated into the circulars governing\nadmission to Grade 1 of government schools and has been communicated to\nprincipals and relevant officers. (marked \u2018P7\u2019). According to Circular\nNo.2008/37 (marked \u2018P9\u2019) dated 19.09.2009 issued by the Secretary to the\nMinistry of Education, the upper limit for the number of students in a class\nfrom Grade 6 to 11 is 45. They also submit that by a subsequent circular\ndated 19.02.2015 (marked \u2018P10\u2019), issued by the Secretary of the Ministry of\nEducation addressed to all principals of schools, admissions to government\nschools were only permitted at Grades 1,6 and 12. The Circular further states\nthat the Secretary's discretion under Circular No. 2008/37 can only be\nexercised in extremely exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the Petitioners\u2019\nposition is that the maximum number of students per class of the year of\nGrade 1 admission for the academic year 2016 was 40 and thereafter there\nshould not be any admission until grade 6. In some schools there are one or\nmore additional classrooms from Grade 6 and upwards to accommodate\nstudents who qualify to be admitted to school on grade 5 scholarship results.\nIn this context, the Petitioners submit that they had a legitimate expectation\nPage 8 of 10", "9": "that by 2021 there would be 5 vacancies in each class that existed from Grade\n1, in addition to the 45 slots of each additional classroom of Grade 6 dedicated\nfor taking in students who succeed in the Grade 5 scholarship examination.\nHowever, the Petitioners have failed to sufficiently establish that there has\nbeen ultra vires or illegal, improper conduct with regard to admissions\nimpacting the year 2021, particularly admissions of Grade 6. And also,\nwhether the Petitioner would have been able to be admitted to such schools,\nif so. While it is established by the Annual Audit Report of the National Audit\nOffice (marked \u2018P11\u2019) that an excessive number of students than the permitted\nnumber, have been admitted to certain schools in 2019, such finding\nregarding 2019 cannot be directly imputed or considered for the year 2021.\nIt is also contended by the Petitioners that while they have obtained high\nmarks, the cut-off marks for the year 2020 is higher than previous years. This\nCourt is of the view that the cut-off marks of a particular year cannot be\ncompared with cut-off marks of the previous years to form any conclusive\nopinion, as the difficulty of the examination and capability of students vary\nfrom year to year amongst various other factors. Therefore, the position that\ncut-off marks of a particular year is higher or lower than another holds no\nmaterial ground for reasoning unless all and several other relevant factors in\nthat regard can be taken into consideration in addition to details on available\nslots.\nFor the above reasons, I dismiss the Application of the Petitioners and make\nno order as to the costs of this Application.\nApplication dismissed, No Costs.\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\nPage 9 of 10", "10": "S. U. B. KARALLIYADDE, J.\nI agree.\nJUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL\nPage 10 of 10"}
